### Debugging

To debug the MSI, build the MSI in debug. This will notify to attach the debugger for every custom action.

To get more verbose information for debugging, you can launch the MSI using:
 > msiexec.exe /i [REPO FOLDER]\Microsoft.InnerEye.Listener\Microsoft.InnerEye.Listener.Wix\bin\x64\Debug\Microsoft.InnerEye.Gateway.msi /L*vx C:\TestLog.txt

 This will write information to C:\TestLog.txt

### Important notes about the project setup

- Do **NOT** remove the non-existant `Service1.Generated.wxs` & `Service2.Generated.wxs` files from this project. This file will be generated while building and is not checked in to git *on purpose*. The file has to be referenced in the project so that WiX picks it up during MSI building!
- The build process harvests the bin/ folder of both services using HEAT. WiX does not allow to exclude files in a convenient way, the only way is to run the resulting XML through a XSL filter (`transform.xsl`). This approach is used here to filter out all executables, as we need to reference the main executable in order to let the installer know what .exe to start when running the services -- referencing harvested files is not possible due to autogenerated IDs.
